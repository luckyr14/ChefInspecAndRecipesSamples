# SQL Server must have allocated audit record storage capacity to meet the organization-defined requirements for saving audit record information.

	## Discussion ##
	#
	# SQL Server does not have the ability to be cognizant of potential audit log
	# storage capacity issues. During the installation and/or configuration process,
	# SQL Server should detect and determine if adequate storage capacity has been
	# allocated for audit logs.
	#
	#
	# During the installation process, a notification may be provided to the
	# installer indicating, based on the auditing configuration chosen and the
	# amount of storage space allocated for audit logs, the amount of storage
	# capacity available is not sufficient to meet storage requirements. SQL Server
	# is not able to send out notice based on adequate storage capacity allocated
	# for the audit logs.
	#
	#
	## Check ##
	#
	# From a Command Prompt, open fsrm.msc.
	# If fsrm.msc is not installed, the File Server Resource Manager is not
	# installed; File and Folder Quota Management is not enabled. If File Server
	# Resource Manager or a third-party tool capable of sending alert notifications
	# based on audit log store requirements is not installed, this is a finding.
	#
	#
	# If fsrm.msc is installed, expand File Server Resource Manager in the left
	# pane.
	#
	# Expand Quota Management.
	# Expand Quotas.
	# If Quotas have not been created for defined Audit Log storage locations, this
	# is a finding.
	#
	#
	## Fix ##
	#
	# Use File Server Resource Manager (FSRM.msc) to enable File and Folder Quota
	# Management and create quotas for identified Audit storage locations.
