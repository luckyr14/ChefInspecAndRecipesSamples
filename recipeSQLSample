# The SQL Server Browser simplifies the administration of SQL Server,
	# particularly when multiple instances of SQL Server coexist on the same
	# computer. It avoids the need to hard-assign port numbers to the instances and
	# to set and maintain those port numbers in client systems. It enables
	# administrators and authorized users to discover database management system
	# instances, and the databases they support, over the network.
	#
	#
	# This convenience also presents the possibility of unauthorized individuals
	# gaining knowledge of the available SQL Server resources. Therefore, it is
	# necessary to consider whether the SQL Server Browser is needed. Typically, if
	# only a single instance is installed, using the default name (MSSQLSERVER) and
	# port assignment (1433), the Browser is not adding any value. The more
	# complex the installation, the more likely SQL Server Browser is to be helpful.
	#
	#
	# This requirement is not intended to prohibit use of the Browser service in any
	# circumstances; rather, it calls for administrators and management to consider
	# whether the benefits of its use outweigh the potential negative consequences.
	#
	#
	## Check ##
	#
	# If the need for the SQL Server Browser service is documented, with appropriate
	# approval, this is not a finding.
	#
	#
	# Open the Services tool.
	#
	# Either navigate, via the Windows Start Menu and/or Control Panel, to
	# "Administrative Tools", and select "Services" or at a command prompt, type
	# "services.msc" and press the "Enter" key.
	#
	#
	# Scroll to "SQL Server Browser".
	#
	# If its Startup Type is not shown as "Disabled", this is a finding.
	#
	## Fix ##
	#
	# If SQL Server Browser is needed, document the justification and obtain the
	# appropriate approvals.
	#
	#
	# Where SQL Server Browser is judged unnecessary, in the Services tool,
	# double-click on "SQL Server Browser" to open its "Properties" dialog. Set
	# Startup Type to "Disabled". If Service Status is "Running", click on "Stop".
	# Click on "OK".
