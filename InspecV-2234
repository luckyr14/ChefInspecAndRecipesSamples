title 'WG040 IIS7: Public web server resources must not be shared with private assets.'
#### WG040 ####
# Public web server resources must not be shared with private assets.
# STIG ID: WG040 IIS7
# Vuln ID: V-2234
## Discussion ##
# It is important to segregate public web server resources from private
resources located behind the DoD DMZ in order to protect private assets. When
folders, drives or other resources are directly shared between the public web
server and private servers the intent of data and resource segregation can be
compromised.
Resources, such as, printers, files, and folders/directories must not be
shared between public web servers and assets located within the internal
network.

## Check ##
1. From a command prompt, type "net share" and press Enter to provide a list
of available shares (including printers).
2. To display the permissions assigned to the shares type "net share" followed
by the share name found in the previous step.
If any private assets are assigned permissions to the share, this is a
finding. If any printers are shared, this is a finding.

## Fix ##
# Configure the public web server to not have a trusted relationship with any
system resource that is also not accessible to the public. Web content is not
to be shared via Microsoft shares or NFS mounts.
